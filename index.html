            <h2>My Background</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Hello! I am currently a student at Dallas College and I am pursuing my Associates degree in Software
            Development. My goal is to graduate next spring because I am excited to start working in this new field as
            soon as possible. I have decided to go back to school so that I can create a new career that is challenging
            and exciting. In the past I have worked in retail and as a receptionist but those careers just didn't seem
            right for me; I really like working with computers and would love to create a work life around that
            interest.</p>
        <p>When I'm not focusing on school, I really love to create things. Baking, writing, and painting are a few of
            the things that bring me joy. Since I like to focus on things that make me happy, I also read, watch movies,
            listen to music, and dance around the house like no one is watching - my dog does
            judge me though! I hope that once this class is over developing websites will bring me joy too!</p>
        <p>I have lived in Texas for over twenty years and have loved it. But I am in an era of trying new things in a
            big way and I figured why not have a new state to go along with my new career! So I am looking at where I
            can move once I graduate. It's overwhelming looking at all of the places I could go but it's also really
            exciting! <em>I'm really just looking forward to the adventure of it all</em>.</p>

            <h2>My Avatar</h2>
        </header>
        <p><img src="webtools/images/girl-with-dragon.jpg" alt="Girl with a Dragon Statue"> In another time and place, I
            am a brave explorer in a fantasy world - I conquer evil-doers, sweep galant princes off of their feet, and
            befriend fiery dragons! In this world, however, I am just a girl who loves to visit renaissance festivals.
        </p>
        <p>My favorite festival to go to is the Scarborough Renaissance Festival in Waxahachie, Texas. I go every year
            and I usually go more than once. I love the atmosphere and the people and the shows. It's an experience I
            look foward to every year! </p>

            <h2>My Web Development Journey</h2>
        </header>
        <p>In high school I took a very basic web development class but we did not learn any HTML coding, which I found
            very disappointing. I have always been very curious as to how websites work behind the scenes so, even
            though this course is required for my software development degree, I was very excited to see that I would
            <em>finally</em> be learning how to make my very own websites!
        </p>
        <p>I am even more excited to see what I can do with this new knowledge! I like to write in my spare time so I am
            looking forward to knowing how to create a space to collect all of my writings. I am also looking forward to
            the possibility of helping my mom make a website for her consulting business, helping a friend create a
            website for her tarot reading business, and helping my sister create a place to come together with fans of
            her books!</p>
